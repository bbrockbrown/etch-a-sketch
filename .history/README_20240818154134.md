This project is from The Odin Project (foundations) and allows one to draw sketches with
their mouse on a grid of any (valid) desired size. This project showcases proficiency of using the 'flexbox' model
and using an external (JavaScript) script to manipulate the DOM. There are small animations throughout the webpage to 
enhance the user experience. Still trying to find a way to compensate for the initial 'zoom-in' upon loading up 
the webpage!
